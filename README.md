IES Light importer for Blender 2.8

![header image](https://github.com/u3dreal/blender28_ies_cycles/blob/master/docs/ies-importer-sc-1000x625.jpg)

Since Blender now supports IES Texture i decided to write a script to speed up the setup.

Simply add an IES Lamp using the add menu and choose the .ies/.ldt file.

The script will setup the light and material node trees.

If you find this helpful please consider supporting me. Thanks !
